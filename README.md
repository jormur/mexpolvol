# Political Violence and Electoral Outcomes in Mexico

## Abstract
Despite the continuous strengthening of governmental institutions in nations all over the world, many nations still see many instances of instability and usurpation in the form of political violence. Previous research has found that these targeted criminal acts dissuade citizens from voting and threaten civil trust. This study builds on that by investigating the effect of political violence on electoral outcomes in Mexico, specifically examining the relationship between organized crime attacks on government officials and party alternation in the municipal office. Using the Criminal Attacks against Political Actors in Mexico (CAPAM) dataset and employing fixed-effects regression models, it is found that the total number of attacks by organized crime does not have a significant impact on party alternation. These results suggest that other contextual factors and mechanisms may overshadow the direct influence of political violence on electoral outcomes. Nonetheless, the findings highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between political violence and electoral processes.
