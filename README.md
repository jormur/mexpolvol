# Political Violence and Electoral Outcomes in Mexico

## Abstract
This study investigates the effect of political violence on electoral outcomes in Mexico, specifically examining the relationship between organized crime attacks on government officials and party alternation in the municipal office. Using the Criminal Attacks against Political Actors in Mexico (CAPAM) dataset and employing fixed-effects regression models, it is found that the total number of attacks by organized crime does not have a significant impact on party alternation. These results suggest that other contextual factors and mechanisms may overshadow the direct influence of political violence on electoral outcomes. Nonetheless, the findings highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between political violence and electoral processes. Further research should explore the specific characteristics of political violence in different municipalities and consider additional contextual factors to gain deeper insights into its effects on electoral outcomes.
